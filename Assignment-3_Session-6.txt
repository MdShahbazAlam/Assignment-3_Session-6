Problem Statement:

1. Use the given link Data Set.

Answer the below questions:

a. Perform ANOVA test on the discriminant analysis scores of nuclear localization signals of both nuclear
and non-nuclear proteins by class variables(Target).
Answer-
# Null Hypothesis : Scores across the class variables is same.
# Alternate Hypothesis : Scores across the class variable(Target) is not same.

x <- aov(nuc~Target_V, data = yeast_data)
summary(x)

# Result
              Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F)    
Target_V       9   1.99 0.22110   21.97 <2e-16 ***
Residuals   1473  14.82 0.01006                   
---
Signif. codes:  0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1

# Since p value is less than 0.05, scores across the class variables is not same at 95% confidence interval.

b. Which class is significantly different from others?
Answer-
TukeyHSD(x)
# ERL is significantly different from others.

# Alternative approac using clustering
# using clustering
